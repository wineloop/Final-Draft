		<h1>It's Soldering Time!</h1>
		<p id="skip">Now that we have all our ingredients. Lets stick some of it together. First, we have to add our
        stabilizers. Because pictures will not do enough justice, 
		<a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_1_5oBVMqo&t=231s" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline;"> here</a> 
		is video that is clear on where and how to mount your stabilizers correctly. The 
        installation begins at 8 minutes and 15 seconds into the video. After the stabilizers are 
        mounted, lay the plate directly on top of the pcb and then putting in the switches. Make sure
        to align the pins correctly with their respective holes as shown below</p>

		<h1> What am I looking at?</h1>  
		<p>Unfortunately, this was the least confusing photo I could find. Essentially, we are seeing the back of the PCB for a single switch. The switch has five holes 
			what have pins going through them in different sizes, colors, and shapes. The pins we care about are the ones going through the golden holes. And these silver 
			pins poking now need to be soldered to create a more secure connection between the switch and pcb. While soldering is not absolutely necessary, you will most likely face
			feedback issues with certin keys</p>
		<p>Brandon Taylor does a solid
			<a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4ujz-noZKk" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline;">guide</a> on soldering and makes 
			the process less daunting then it should be. As mentioned in the video, it is key to make sure
			you are in a ventilated area and consider wearing safety goggles in the event of a freak accident.
			And finally, make sure to only apply heat on the pad for about 2-4 seconds max to avoid
			damaging the pcb. Although PCBs are built to withstand immense heat, it is generally not in your
			best interest to limit test on an expensive piece of tech.
